# Singular Value Decomposition for a fluid dynamics application

This repository contains a python script with a solution to Exercise 1-7. from <i>Brunton, S., & Kutz, J. (2022). Data-Driven Science and Engineering: Machine Learning, Dynamical Systems, and Control (2nd ed.). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. (doi:10.1017/9781009089517).</i>

In the exercise one is given a data set for fluid flow past a cylinder. It is asked to analyze the data by applying Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) technique.
